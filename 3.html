Project ARCHON â€“ Assisted Rehab Care Home Of Nurturing was initiated by the Founder Director Dr. Rachna Kumar in 2008, to establish a state of the art facility for elder care and services. She felt an acute need for such a home, keeping in mind the many Seniors living alone as their children are abroad and also the disintegration of joint family creating an acute need as Seniors are living alone, facing insecurity and loneliness. Dr. Rachna, a physical therapist by training was also concerned with changing needs of Seniors as they age naturally, as this necessitated an Assisted home with care facility. While in US on a green card, she worked in several hospitals and studied international standards and quality of Assisted Home. She gave up her green card to give full-time to this project and now after 10 years, the project is undergoing final finishing.
